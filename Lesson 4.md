Computers The Way Your Kids Use Them 4: Images in Word

This last lesson is a mini-lesson. Honestly, if you conquered Devices, you probably don't need my help.

Working with images in Microsoft Word is often frustrating, as it is above all a word processing system. However, since it is more convenient than many programs that handle images better (e.g. InDesign), it is worth learning what concessions Microsoft has made to the need for image handling. 

This week's lesson is a treasure hunt. In a word document, do each of these things:
Import an image from your photo collection.
Import a diagram, e.g. a color wheel or a free body diagram from Google Images.
Import a clip art image of a cat through Word's native features.
Copy and paste all of the text from http://pub.psi.cc/ihnmaims.txt into your document, and arrange your images so they are interspersed with the text.
Try all the different functions of text wrapping with all the different images.
In particular, wrap "tight" with the clip art image.
For your diagram, find and use the "remove background" feature.
Try every button.

Bonus: read the story. It's good and thought-provoking, if disturbing.
