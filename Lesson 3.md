Computers The Way Your Kids Use Them 3: Devices

*Note: This lesson refers to printer troubles. If you don't have any of those at the moment, well, good. But go ahead and follow along- most of the lesson will actually be easier if nothing is broken.

Inspired by your recent struggles with the printer and internet, I've decided to make this week's assignment about troubleshooting devices that interface with your computer- with the printer as an example.
It might not work, and it might be frustrating- as you know, we can't always fix your weird printer and internet issues either. But I think it will be worthwhile to go through some troubleshooting steps.

Note: In your previous assignments, I have been teaching you the invaluable computer skill of solving your problems by Googling it. Keep that in your toolbox (we'll use it, too) while we add a new skill: trying to fix things by clicking on everything that looks promising.

It's possible that none of this will help or make sense. Try a bit of it earlier in the week; if it looks like it's going to be that way, we should schedule a time to skype and work on it together.

First, you need to make sure that your computer is aware of the printer. Here are two ways to look for it:

(1) Start Menu > Devices and Printers. This is your "Control Panel" view of your devices. This view is user-friendly: it's not very powerful, but you really can't screw anything up by clicking on things.
It should have some pretty little icons to represent all the things that are connected to your computer. Up above, in "Devices", you should see your mouse, your keyboard, webcam if you're on your laptop. Down below, in "Printers and Faxes", look for your printer. Is it there?
If it's there, then right clicking on the icon of the printer will give you some options. Explore these, particularly familiarizing yourself with what is available under the various options including the words "properties" or "preferences". Click around in these, taking note of buttons you might need to use sometime.
Note also that there is a "Troubleshoot" button. Go ahead and click it. Why not? It's never helped me, but maybe for you it'll be useful. Step through the troubleshooting wizard until your problems are solved or you lose faith in the troubleshooting wizard.
While we're here in the Control Panel view, also notice the "Add a Device" and "Add a Printer" buttons on the top left of the main screen. You might need those.

(2) The Device Manager: Start Menu > type "Device Manager".
This is your less user-friendly view of really ALL the things your computer is connected to. You would still be hard-pressed to mess anything up by clicking buttons, but I don't know what all the buttons do for sure. Just don't right click and Uninstall any devices and you should be fine.
You probably won't need to use this view to solve your printer issues, but I thought you should be aware of its existence.
Look around. Notice that there are a lot more things to click on than in your Control Panel view, and you won't know what all of them are.
Click on the little triangle next to "Network Adapters" and you should probably see linksys or whatever your home wifi is.
There should also be "Printers" in the list of devices. Click on that and see if your printer is there. If it is, right click and notice the option "update driver software". Though it's probably not the issue in this case (printer drivers rarely update), sometimes a device might misbehave due to out-of-date drivers.


Okay, so that was interesting but probably didn't fix anything.
Honestly, the next step is largely floundering around, but here are some directions to try:

Have you gotten an error code at any point? Copy the error code number if there is one or the exact text of the error (in quotation marks) into Google. See what you learn.

Did your printer fail to show up in either the Control Panel or Device Manager views above? Try turning the printer and computer off and on again.

Are you connected over USB to the printer? Unplug it and plug it back in again and see if your computer makes a sound. If it does, it recognizes at least that there is a device being connected.  Sometimes this makes a screen pop up that tells you what to do.

Google your printer, along with key words such as "connection", "network connection", or "connection issues". Or if you can think of something more specific that's wrong, use that.
Usually, you will get one or two results from the printer's manufacturing company discussing the problem in general, and several help forums where someone with the same problem as you has asked the internet for help and (probably) gotten a response. Click on several of these links and see if they're helpful: skim to the description of the problem. If it is dissimilar to yours, move on to a different link. If it sounds like the same problem you are having, try some of the suggested solutions. If they don't work, try another suggestion or a different link.

In your place, this is what I would do. Try each of these things, but if they don't work, seek higher authority.
