<b>Computers The Way Your Kids Use Them 1: Table of Contents</b>

Your first lesson:

Find Microsoft Office training courses for the version of Word you have through office.microsoft.com.<br />
<i>Hint 1: It may be easier to google training courses for your version of word by googling it and then selecting the official microsoft one than by going directly through office.microsoft.com</i><br />
<i>Hint 2: Don't know which version of Word you have? Google "What version of Word do I have" or similar.</i>

Find three separate tutorials for how to make a table of contents for your version of Word. One should be on the Microsoft Office site, one on YouTube, and another from another separate site. Send me the links.

Using one of the three tutorials or some other method, create a table of contents in Microsoft Word.
