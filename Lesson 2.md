Computers The Way Your Kids Use Them 2: Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to save time on the computer. They're so useful that once you start using them, it's really hard to stop. They also look like magic to the uninitiated, so when you're watching us do things on the computer and have no idea where something came from, it's probably because we used a keyboard shortcut. This week's lesson is on how to save time and impress your friends with keyboard shortcuts.

I'm not sure which ones you already know, so I'll just assign you all the essential ones. Learn them and practice. It might be a good idea (as far as remembering them) to practice just one or two a day for the next week.

In order to learn keyboard shortcuts, google them. You can google for the keyboard shortcut for a specific command, or by looking up a list of all of the keyboard shortcuts for Windows.
Copy my list of commands into a Word document and type out the keyboard shortcut next to it.

Essentials in manipulating text:
Copy
Cut
Paste
Select all

System Commands:
Save
Print
Close program

Navigation:
Switch between open programs
In an internet browser, switch between open tabs
Open Windows explorer (My Computer)
Open the Start menu

Pick three to five more keyboard shortcuts that you didn't know and add them to your list.

Bonus: Gmail also has its own keyboard shortcuts! Look up what they are and how to turn them on.

Now, without using your mouse AT ALL, open Windows Explorer, navigate to the Word Document with the keyboard shortcuts in it, and open it. Open your internet browser, go to Gmail, and open a response to an email (if you didn't do the bonus, you can use your mouse to open a response). Copy the list of keyboard shortcuts and paste them in the email. Send if appropriate (again, if you didn't do the bonus, you can use your mouse to send).
